  'Vitamin D3 supplementation timing matters for circadian alignment — morning dosing coincides with natural UV-B exposure and supports endogenous synthesis pathways. Sublingual or oil-suspended forms outperform dry tablets for absorption. Co-administration with magnesium and vitamin K2 is standard practice for bone calcium targeting.',
  'Mitochondrial biogenesis responds to cold thermogenesis via PGC-1α upregulation. Brown adipose tissue activation increases with repeated 10-15 minute exposures below 15°C. The adaptive response compounds over 4-6 weeks. Population studies show metabolic flexibility improvements independent of caloric restriction.',
  'Serum ferritin above 200 ng/mL in the absence of iron-deficient anemia often reflects inflammatory state rather than iron overload. hs-CRP co-elevation and transferrin saturation below 45% distinguish acute-phase response from hemochromatosis. HFE genotyping is warranted only when TSAT exceeds 45% persistently.',
  'APOE ε4 carriers show differential lipid response to saturated fat intake compared to ε3 homozygotes. Cardiovascular risk stratification should factor in genotype. Mediterranean-pattern diets appear to mitigate the ε4 penalty in most intervention trials but not all, and the heterogeneity likely reflects background polygenic risk.',
  'GABA-A receptor agonism underlies much of the sedative effect of chamomile-derived apigenin and the flavonoids in valerian root. These act at the benzodiazepine site but with substantially lower efficacy — useful clinically for not producing tolerance in short courses. Drug interactions with licensed GABA-ergic agents are clinically relevant.',
