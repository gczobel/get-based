      '<b>Get more useful local sun context.</b> Use your home area or optionally share a privacy-rounded current location for today\'s conditions, UV, sun position, and the transition from sunrise into meaningful UVA availability.',
      '<b>Follow sun sessions more easily.</b> Set up skin type, coverage, glass, and eye conditions before starting. The live session card keeps the vitamin D estimate visible, shows the other light channels on demand, and works consistently on the Light page and dashboard.',
      '<b>Review patterns without chasing numbers.</b> Light Today explains the current day, while the Weekly Review looks across recent sessions and suggests one practical next step.',
      '<b>Keep sunlight and light devices distinct.</b> Device sessions reflect their specific spectrum, output, distance, and exposure area. Numerical estimates appear only when the available device information supports them.',
      '<b>Understand your indoor light environment.</b> Assess rooms, save observations, and use source-aware tools for brightness, warm/cool appearance, camera-visible banding, darkness, and relative window comparisons. Brightness prefers the phone\'s light sensor or an entered meter reading; a calibrated camera estimate is labeled as approximate.',

      '<b>Evidence is easier to check.</b> SNP findings include relevant publication links and clearer evidence context, plus a direct way to suggest a correction.',
      '<b>Mitochondrial DNA has been improved.</b> More maternal haplogroup subclades are supported, and the mitochondrial climate and environmental-fit view is more complete and easier to use.',
      '<b>Ask AI stays focused without limiting the model.</b> Routine context remains compact, while asking about a finding adds its relevant details and still lets your selected model use broader knowledge.',

      '<b>Your genome and other profile data are better protected.</b> If a saved profile cannot be read, sync now stops safely instead of treating that profile as empty and sending a blank replacement to your other devices.',

Beneath your own diagnoses, a new <b>Family history</b> subsection captures first-degree relatives plus grandparents (mother, father, sibling, child, maternal/paternal grandmothers and grandfathers). Each entry takes a condition, optional age of onset, and an optional note. Family history reframes risk interpretation — a father\'s heart attack at 52 makes a borderline LDL more actionable, and the AI sees both your own diagnoses and what runs in the family.',
      '<b>The conditions list nearly tripled.</b> Was 27 entries (mostly metabolic / endocrine / GI). Now ~117, covering neuro (Alzheimer\'s, Parkinson\'s, Epilepsy, MS, migraine), 19 cancer categories (breast, prostate, colorectal, lung, melanoma, pancreatic, ovarian, lymphoma, leukemia, …), skin (Psoriasis, eczema, rosacea), mental health (bipolar, ADHD, autism, PTSD, OCD), additional autoimmune, musculoskeletal, eye, hearing, infectious / chronic, and several genetic / congenital conditions worth surfacing in family history. Autocomplete-clickable conditions with apostrophes (Alzheimer\'s, Hashimoto\'s, Crohn\'s, Graves\', Sjögren\'s, Cushing\'s, Parkinson\'s, Huntington\'s) — previously broken from the dropdown — are clickable again.',
      '<b>Notes on individual lab values.</b> Every reading in the marker detail modal now has a small <b>+ note</b> on hover. Attach context tied to a single date/marker: <i>"fasted 14h"</i>, <i>"retook because cuff felt loose"</i>, <i>"different lab"</i>, <i>"post-workout"</i>. Notes show as an italic line beneath the value; click to edit, × to remove. The AI sees these notes grouped by marker so a single reading\'s context can change how it\'s interpreted.',
      '<b>Manual entry is much faster for paper lab reports.</b> The marker modal\'s "+ Add Value" button moved above the Note section and is renamed <b>+ Add Value Manually</b> for clarity. The form gained: a <b>Save & Add Another</b> button that keeps the date and clears the value (enter a whole report top-to-bottom without re-picking dates), an optional <b>Note</b> field that saves to the per-value notes above, a <b>range sanity check</b> that flags values >10× the upper bound or <1/10 the lower bound (catches decimal/unit slips), a <b>duplicate-date confirm</b> that shows the existing value before overwriting, and a <b>session-remembered last date</b> so the next entry defaults to whatever date you just used. Plus: Enter to save, Esc to cancel, no future dates allowed.',
      '<b>Click any empty cell in Table view to add a value</b> with that column\'s date pre-filled. The view mode (Charts / Table / Heatmap) now sticks across navigation and survives saves.',

      '<b>Table and Heatmap views hide markers you have no data for.</b> A 50-row category with values in 8 markers no longer scrolls past 42 rows of dashes — only markers with at least one reading render. Categories with no data at all show a one-line "import a PDF or use the sidebar" hint instead of an empty table.',

      '<b>Inline value editing</b> now uses a full-width input instead of an 80px cell that clipped multi-digit values, refreshes the underlying table/heatmap on save (was showing stale values), and treats Escape as a real cancel (no longer flips your imported value to "manual" if you press Esc without changing anything).',
      '<b>PDF import accepts extensionless files</b> — magic-byte sniff catches files exported with no extension (common with OCRFeeder on Linux).',
      '<b>Wearable manual entry got chip + note parity.</b> The "+ Add reading" form in the detail modal now offers the same context chips (resting / morning-fasted / post-workout / stress for BP and RHR) and a freeform note field that the dashboard empty-card form has had. Notes show up under the reading in the entries list, and feed the AI alongside the numbers.',
      '<b>Category navigation no longer bounces to Dashboard.</b> Clicking 3M / 6M / 1Y range buttons, deleting a value, or saving a PDF import — anywhere the sidebar rebuilds in response — used to read a stale "active" state and redirect you to Dashboard. Fixed across all 10 places that had the pattern.',
      '<b>Bugfixes & improvements.</b> Family-history relative picker is grouped into Parents / Siblings & Children / Maternal grandparents / Paternal grandparents. Each family-history entry shows a small relative chip with emoji so a long list reads scannably by "who" before "what". The add-entry form stacks cleanly into two rows on mobile. Manual-entry value input width is now responsive (was clipping 6+ digit values like cholesterol or testosterone). Friendlier empty-state hints throughout Table / Heatmap / Family-history sections. Cross-device sync covers the new per-value notes and family history under the same per-row CRDT path everything else uses — no migration needed.',
