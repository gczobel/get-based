    albumin: { name: "Albumin", unit: "g/l", refMin: 35.0, refMax: 52.0, desc: "The most abundant blood protein made by the liver; low levels indicate malnutrition, liver disease, or chronic inflammation." },
    globulin: { name: "Globulin", unit: "g/l", refMin: 20.0, refMax: 35.0, desc: "Combined non-albumin proteins, often calculated as total protein minus albumin; changes can reflect immune, liver, or protein-loss conditions." },

    ceruloplasmin: { name: "Ceruloplasmin", unit: "g/l", refMin: 0.15, refMax: 0.30, desc: "A copper-carrying protein produced by the liver; low levels suggest Wilson disease, high levels indicate inflammation." },
    neurofilamentLight: { name: "Neurofilament Light", unit: "pg/ml", refMin: null, refMax: 12, desc: "Plasma axonal-injury marker. The dashboard uses age-specific assay upper limits when date of birth is available, but the reporting laboratory, specimen type, assay platform, kidney function, and clinical neurologic context take priority; no wellness optimum is claimed." }
