    vitaminD: { name: "Vitamin D Total", unit: "nmol/l", refMin: 75.0, refMax: 250.0, desc: "Sum of D2 and D3 forms; essential for calcium absorption, bone health, immune function, and mood regulation." },
    vitaminD3: { name: "Vitamin D3", unit: "nmol/l", refMin: 50.0, refMax: 175.0, desc: "The form of vitamin D produced by sun exposure and supplements; the most bioactive and clinically relevant form." },
    calcitriol: { name: "Calcitriol (1,25-(OH)\u2082D)", unit: "pmol/l", refMin: 36.5, refMax: 216.2, desc: "The active hormonal form of vitamin D produced by the kidneys; regulates calcium absorption and bone metabolism. Ordered for kidney disease or calcium disorders." },
    vitaminA: { name: "Vitamin A", unit: "\u00b5mol/l", refMin: 1.05, refMax: 2.80, desc: "A fat-soluble vitamin essential for vision, immune defense, and cell growth; both deficiency and excess are harmful." },
    vitaminB12: { name: "Vitamin B12", unit: "pmol/l", refMin: 145, refMax: 569, desc: "Total circulating B12; useful screening marker but can look normal when active B12 delivery or functional markers are strained." },
    activeB12: { name: "Active B12 (holotranscobalamin)", unit: "pmol/l", refMin: 35, refMax: null, desc: "Holotranscobalamin, the biologically available B12 fraction delivered to cells; often more actionable than total B12 for methylation and neurologic context." },
    methylmalonicAcid: { name: "Methylmalonic Acid", unit: "nmol/l", refMin: null, refMax: 350, desc: "Functional B12 marker; elevated values suggest impaired B12-dependent metabolism, especially when total B12 looks acceptable." },
    folate: { name: "Folate", unit: "nmol/l", refMin: 7.0, refMax: 45.3, desc: "B-vitamin critical for DNA synthesis and methylation; deficiency causes macrocytic anemia and elevated homocysteine. Key in pregnancy for neural tube prevention." },
    vitaminB1: { name: "Vitamin B1 (Thiamine)", unit: "nmol/l", refMin: 70, refMax: 180, desc: "Whole-blood thiamine status supporting carbohydrate metabolism and neurologic function; specimen type and method must match the laboratory interval." },
    vitaminB6: { name: "Vitamin B6 (PLP)", unit: "nmol/l", refMin: 20, refMax: 125, desc: "Pyridoxal-5-phosphate, the main circulating B6 marker. The optional optimal band raises the lower edge to the EFSA adequacy threshold of 30 nmol/l while retaining the lab upper bound; supplement use can raise PLP substantially." },
    vitaminC: { name: "Vitamin C", unit: "\u00b5mol/l", refMin: 23, refMax: 114, desc: "Plasma ascorbate reflecting recent vitamin C availability. The optional optimal band starts at the commonly used adequacy threshold of 50 µmol/l; its upper edge remains the lab bound because concentrations above nutritional saturation are not automatically harmful. Fasting and prompt specimen handling improve interpretation." },
    vitaminE: { name: "Vitamin E (Alpha-Tocopherol)", unit: "\u00b5mol/l", refMin: 12, refMax: 42, desc: "Primary circulating form of vitamin E; interpret alongside lipid concentrations because transport depends on lipoproteins." }
