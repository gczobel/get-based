Use the reporting laboratory's interval and equation context; KitBasis does not derive this estimate from the component concentrations. Muscle mass and non-filtration influences on either marker still matter." },

The optional 22–26 optimal band is a general-population lower-risk association, not an acid-base treatment target; interpret it with electrolytes, kidney and lung context, and the reporting laboratory." },

    amylase: { name: "Amylase", unit: "\u00b5kat/l", refMin: 0.47, refMax: 1.67, desc: "Digestive enzyme produced mainly by the pancreas and salivary glands; elevations require clinical context and are less pancreas-specific than lipase." },
    lipase: { name: "Lipase", unit: "\u00b5kat/l", refMin: 0.22, refMax: 1.00, desc: "Pancreatic fat-digesting enzyme used when pancreatic inflammation is suspected; laboratory intervals vary by method." },
    osmolality: { name: "Serum Osmolality", unit: "mOsm/kg", refMin: 275, refMax: 295, desc: "Concentration of dissolved particles in serum; supports evaluation of hydration, sodium disorders, and osmolar gaps." },
